Time complexity:
Big o, Big omega and Big theta notations
Big theta is the most efficient
1(better)<logn<n<nlogn<n^2<n^3<2^n<n^n(worse)
best case, worse case and average case
the algorithm must do good in the worst case to be efficient
We also calculate space complexity
Calculate the time complexity as a function of input since, every computer has different working time and cannot execute the code in the same time
